ABOUT THE PROJECT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This project aims at implementing the VGA interface on Altera's DE0 
development board. This is utilized by a custom Qsys component that
accesses the SDRAM via the Avalon Bus. The frame buffer is stored
inside the SDRAM and via a softcore processor like the NIOS II and the
included graphics driver, the vga_controller component can be 
configured and started.

Supported graphic modes are:
	* 640x480@60Hz & 12-bit color
