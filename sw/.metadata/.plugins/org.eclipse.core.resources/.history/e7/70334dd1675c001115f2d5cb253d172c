 *	This file contains definitions, macros and functions that make up the VGA interface driver for the DE0
 *	development board. The driver functionality is focused around modification of the frame buffer.
 *
 *  The frame buffer is ordered in segments, each segment consists of 5 pixels in a horizontal row.
 *  Each segment has a size of 64 bits. Each pixel consists of 12 bits.
